# Going-Native Slack Bot

This is a Slack bot that I am developing to research the Slack platform and respective APIs

The bot is developed in Node.js (v 8.11.2) it is an incomplete project and I am not intending to deploy it for real use. 

Currently the bot resides in a private workspace where I do a lot of testing.

**Tools used:**

HTTPS Module node

ngrok

Slack/Events-API

**Note**

The token keys  shown in the commit history are old.

**Usage**

If you'd like to use this project as a starting point for developing your own bot for Slack you can simply git clone the project. Node and npm should be installed. Once you are in a terminal and are in the root project directory you can initiate the project by issuing the command "node index.js".



The project is named Going-Native after a song by the band Summer Salt
