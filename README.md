# Going-Native
This is a Slack bot that I am developing to research the Slack platform and respective APIs
The bot is developed in Node.JS and I am not intending to deploy it for real use. 
Currently the bot resides in a private workspace where I do a lot of testing.

Tools that I use:
Native HTTPS.request module provided by Node
nGrok for receiving HTTP requests from the Slack APIs
Slack/Events API

The project is named Going-Native after a song.
