# Going-Native Slack Bot

This is a Slack bot that I am developing to research the Slack platform and respective APIs

The bot is developed in Node.JS and I am not intending to deploy it for real use. 

Currently the bot resides in a private workspace where I do a lot of testing.

**Tools used:**
HTTPs.Request Module node
ngrok
Slack/Events-API

The project is named Going-Native after a song by the band Summer Salt
